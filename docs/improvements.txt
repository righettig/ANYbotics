-> Online events (users can code their BOT behaviour)
	
	WIP React app for admins	
		dockerize the app
		define kubernetes cluster so that I can start the whole thing at once without having port issues
		
		-> create/read/update/delete events (attach microservice)
			update events ms 

		
	
		
	scenario
		user1 submit behaviour
		user1 should NOT be able to see the "NEW event", instead it should see a list of subscribed events
		
		user2 submit behaviour
		
		admin to log in and see list of events with submissions
			user1, timestamp, language?, [optional: it should be possible to download source code]
			user2, timestamp, language?
				click on <START_EVENT>
				admin sees "Running" as event status (event completes in 30 seconds) (stubbed)
					start_time, end_time should be displayed and recorded as logs to be later read, and who won
					
		[simulation starts for all users]
			
		users upon logging in from the Events\1 they should see status "running" + start timestamp | end timestamp
			after 30 secs a winner is picked up and displayed on screen			
			
		users should be able to access the "old" event page and see status "finished" with the winner
			also start_timestamp and end_timestamp
		
	Iteration #2
		simulation loop implemented according to:
			https://chatgpt.com/c/5a92b347-182f-41b4-9825-8ed5fcec16f8
			https://chatgpt.com/c/d1a63a09-ef6d-48c1-bf66-d7282742c8b6
	
	Iteration #3
		stubbed code (csharp, typescript, python) is compiled
		everything else the same
		
	Iteration #4
		compiled code is used to generate "moves"
		
	Iteration #5
		Implemented event logic (i.e. rules) to decide when the simulation is finished
		
	Iteration #6
		Use babylon.js or three.js to render scene in real time

	Iteration #7 User companion app, 
		users can check real time status of events and get notifications
		React Native


- [Authorize] to protect controllers: https://bitbucket.org/RAPHAEL_BICKEL/aspnetcore.firebase.authentication/src/master/
- Fleet (group agents)
- SetManualMode should support bool payload | UI should be autogenerate based on back-end definition
- NgRx, convert shutdown, recharge, wake up actions
- Use Angular signals
- Download logs, images as bulk or single images, fullscreen images

BUGS
	1) Cleanup signalR server side subscriptions
	2) After "Shutdown" command any other command is executed by the agent BUT not logged in the console
