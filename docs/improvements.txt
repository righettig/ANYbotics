1) Fleet (group agents)

2) SetManualMode should support bool payload | UI should be autogenerate based on back-end definition

3) NgRx, convert shutdown, recharge, wake up actions

4) Use Angular signals

5) Download logs, images as bulk or single images, fullscreen images

6) [Authorize] to protect controllers

7) Admin: it should be possible to create new users and change their roles

8) Refactoring & cleanup "LiveFeed" component

BUGS
	1) Cleanup signalR server side subscriptions
	2) After "Shutdown" command any other command is executed by the agent BUT not logged in the console
