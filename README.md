### Project: **Robotic Fleet Management Dashboard**

**Objective:** Create a web-based dashboard for managing and monitoring a fleet of mobile robots, demonstrating real-time data visualization, seamless user interactions, and integration with backend services.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dashboard Overview:**
   - Display a summary of all robots, including their status (active, idle, offline), location, battery levels, and recent activities.

2. **Robot Details Page:**
   - Provide detailed information for each robot, such as current tasks, health metrics, sensor data, and visual feed if applicable.

3. **Real-time Data Updates:**
   - Implement real-time updates for robot status and location using WebSockets or another real-time data protocol.

4. **Interactive Map:**
   - Integrate a map component (e.g., using Google Maps or Leaflet) to visualize the robots' locations and their paths.

5. **Task Assignment:**
   - Allow users to assign tasks to robots and track their progress.

6. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement a simple user authentication system to demonstrate secure access to the dashboard.

7. **Data Visualization:**
   - Use charts and graphs to visualize historical data and performance metrics of the robots.

8. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the dashboard is fully responsive and works seamlessly on various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

**Technical Stack:**

- **Frontend:** Angular v17, Angular Material, SCSS, TypeScript, RxJS
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress
- **State Management:** NgRx or another state management library
- **Data Visualization:** D3.js or Chart.js
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets or Firebase
- **Mapping:** Google Maps API, Leaflet, or Babylon.js for 3D visualization
- **Backend:** A simple Node.js/Express server to simulate API responses (if needed)
- **CI/CD:** Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI

**Presentation:**

- **Demo:** Prepare a live demo of your project, showcasing different features and interactions.
- **Code Walkthrough:** Be ready to walk through your code, explaining your design choices, how you structured the application, and how you handled challenges.
- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation, including a README file with setup instructions, a summary of the project, and a list of features.

- **Performance:** Showcase any optimizations you’ve made for performance, especially for real-time data handling.
- **Best Practices:** Highlight your adherence to software engineering best practices, such as code modularity, maintainability, and use of design patterns.

## Back-end

### Project: Robotic Inspection Dashboard with Real-Time Data Processing

**Objective:**
Develop a web-based dashboard that integrates with a robotic system (simulated or real) to perform real-time data processing and inspection tasks. This project should demonstrate your ability to create scalable backend systems, APIs, and a user-friendly interface.

**Key Components:**

1. **Backend System:**
   - **API Development:** Build RESTful or gRPC APIs for interaction between the robot and the dashboard.
   - **Data Processing:** Implement real-time data processing from the robot (e.g., sensor data, image processing).
   - **Database Management:** Use a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store inspection data and logs.

2. **Robot Simulation:**
   - **Simulated Environment:** Use a robot simulation platform (e.g., Gazebo, ROS) to mimic the robot’s inspection tasks.
   - **Sensor Integration:** Simulate sensor data (e.g., temperature, pressure, images) that the robot would collect during inspections.

3. **Web Dashboard:**
   - **User Interface:** Create a web-based dashboard using a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular) to visualize real-time data and inspection results.
   - **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
   - **Interactive Maps:** Integrate maps to show the robot’s location and inspection path within the facility.

4. **Cloud Integration:**
   - **Cloud Services:** Integrate with cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalable data storage and processing.
   - **Deployment:** Deploy the backend and frontend on cloud platforms to demonstrate scalability.

5. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - **Code Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for your code and APIs.
   - **Automated Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the system.
   - **Simulation Testing:** Demonstrate the system using the robot simulation in different scenarios.

**Technologies to Use:**
- **Backend:** Python, Node.js, or C++ with frameworks like Flask, Express.js, or FastAPI.
- **APIs:** RESTful or gRPC APIs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **Frontend:** React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- **Robot Simulation:** ROS (Robot Operating System), Gazebo.
- **Cloud Services:** AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for deployment and storage.

**Presentation:**
- **Demo:** Prepare a live demo or a recorded video demonstrating the robot performing inspection tasks, data being processed in real-time, and results displayed on the dashboard.
- **Architecture Diagram:** Present an architecture diagram showing the interaction between different components.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** Discuss the challenges you faced during development and the solutions you implemented.
- **Future Enhancements:** Suggest potential improvements and additional features that could be added to the project.
